# Hellos, Tiberio's here!
I’m currently studying a master's in Business Analytics, improving my knowledge in data science and developing data visualization skills.

I’m looking for new experiences and challenges that spur me to improve myself more and more.

I love to watch and practice sports like basketball or football.
