# 👋 Hey there!

👨‍🎓 My name is Tiberio and I am a graduate with a Master of Science in Business Analytics (August 2022) from Hult International Business School, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Another Master's Degree of Science that I obtained was in Finance, especially quantitative and computational, at the Ca 'Foscari University of Venice, in October 2021. Previously I graduated from the University of Trento with a Bachelor's Degree in Economics and Management, in July 2019.

✈💻 Treviso native, based in Boston. Passionate about data analysis and forecasting to help businesses and other entities make data-driven decisions that can help increase effectiveness and performance to foster their growth.

🖥🖱 Throughout the Master's Degree in Business Analytics I've developed a great knowledge and passion for programming languages, such as Python, R and SQL, of enormous importance for data analysis, data visualization and data management. Please look at my projects on GitHub https://github.com/tiberiofavaretto, in which there are individual and group works made in my academic career.

📊📋 In addition to my interest in Data Science, I decided to specialize in Entrepreneurship during my summer electives at Hult. During the Disruptive Business Model we have, as members of the board of directors of important companies, simulated negotiations and partnerships with other companies in order to introduce disruptive ideas in the market in which we operated. I therefore improved my skills in finding business growth potential and innovation.

⚾🎬🥦 My hobbies include watching and playing sports, including baseball, basketball, American football, ice hockey and soccer; watch movies and TV series, especially those inspired by and based on true stories; reading Isaac Asimov's books and cooking, especially vegan cooking.
